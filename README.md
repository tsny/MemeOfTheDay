# MemeOfTheDay
This time without free API keys! I PROMISE

A simple python project that posts a random meme from a supply on my server to my Twitter every day at 6 PM.

And yes those API keys from that first commit no longer work.

To use:

1) Clone this repo
2) Create a folder in this repo called 'memes'
3) Put a .jpg or .png in the new 'memes' folder
4) Create a file called 'login.json'
5) Write your Consumer and Access keys and secrets into it in this format:

{  
    "loginDetails":  
	{  
        "consumerKey": "gasgasgsgsadgagasg",  
        "consumerSecret": "gasdgasdftew geagasgsdagsdg",  
        "accessKey": "4343262-gsadgsdfasdfewaysyta",  
        "accessSecret": "6t34634fdsafdsaffdsfasfsdaf"
	}  
}  

6) Run memeoftheday.py
